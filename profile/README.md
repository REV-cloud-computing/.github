🚀 Welcome to My Cloud Journey — Revan Somshekhar Chonnad☁️✨

Welcome to my exploration of modern **cloud architecture and backend systems**, built as part of **CSYE6225 – Network Structures & Cloud Computing** at Northeastern University. This project represents my hands-on experience designing **scalable, secure, and automated cloud infrastructure on AWS**, with a strong emphasis on real-world engineering practices.

Get ready to dive into the systems, infrastructure, and automation behind production-ready cloud deployments.

## 🌍 Project Blueprint: Highlights

### 🌠 Architecture at a Glance
- End-to-end **cloud architecture design**
- Thoughtfully structured networking, compute, and security layers
- High availability and fault tolerance baked in from day one

### 🌩️ Engineering in Action

**Web Application**
A Node.js–powered REST API designed with:
- Secure file uploads to Amazon S3 using IAM-based permissions
- Fully automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Centralized logging and monitoring using CloudWatch

**Infrastructure as Code**
All infrastructure provisioned using Terraform, including:
- Multi-AZ VPC architecture with public and private subnets
- NAT Gateways for controlled outbound connectivity
- Auto Scaling Groups for handling variable traffic
- KMS-encrypted RDS and S3 resources for data protection

**Serverless Exploration**
- Initial experimentation with Node.js–based AWS Lambda functions *(work in progress)*

---

## 🔒 Security-First Design

- **AWS KMS** for encryption of EBS volumes, RDS databases, and S3 buckets
- **AWS Secrets Manager** to securely manage sensitive credentials
- **CloudWatch Dashboards and Alarms** for visibility, monitoring, and alerting
